    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis document describes the methodology carried out for the stratification and selection of population centers in Loreto for drone surveillance. This activity is part of the the Harmonize project: Harmonisation of spatio-temporal multi-scale data for health in climate change hotspots in the Peruvian Amazon (SIDISI 209821), in collaboration with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center.\nThe Harmonize project has the following objectives:\n\nGeo-location of cases collected by passive surveillance from the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MINSA) through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC-Peru) in the study area using GPS devices.\nIdentify potential mosquito breeding sites based on new longitudinal ground survey data and using drone surveillance.\nCollect data from weather stations, satellite imagery, ambient acoustic sounds and air pollution to calibrate and reduce the spatial resolution of Earth observation data sets.\nDetermine the impact of the use of these new technologies on infectious disease reduction interventions carried out by the Direcci√≥n Regional de Salud (DIRESA) of Loreto.\n\nThe methodology described here corresponds to the second objective above. Since we cannot map the whole study area of Loreto, our approach was to characterize the population centers in Loreto according to the incidence of relevant diseases in the area (Malaria, Dengue and Leptospirosis) and meteorological, environmental and human intervention variables (temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, deforestation, etc.) and then use this variables to create sampling strata using clustering techniques. Finally, we randomly sampled a number of the population centers from each stratum proportional to the stratum size."

    "section": "3 Stratification",
    "text": "3 Stratification\nThe stratification of the population centers consisted of using the meteorological, environmental and human intervention variables to built groups of population centers with homogeneous characteristics. For this purpose, we tested two approaches. The first one consisted of performing an Agglomerative (‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù) Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) analysis using different distances, linkage methods, and number of clusters selection methods. On the second one, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of the variables to one principal dimension and used it‚Äôs scores to create groups by quantile classification.\n\n3.1 Agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis\nThe AHC analysis consisted of two steps. First, we run several configurations the agglomerative nesting algorithms and selected the one which gave us the best hierarchical clustering (HC) structure. Secondly, from the selected hierarchical clustering structure, we calculated and examined a number of indices for determining the most appropriate number of clusters.\n\n3.1.1 Chosing the hierarchical clustering structure\nFor this first step, we tested combinations of the following methods:\n\nScaling method: Whether to use normalization (scaling from 0 to 1) or standardadization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation).\nDistance: Whether to use euclidean distance or correlation-based distances, such as Pearson or Spearman correlation.\nLinkage method: Whether to use average, single, complete, Ward or weighted average linkage method.\n\nFor each combination, we run the agglomerative nesting algorithm and calculated the agglomerative coefficient (AC) which is a measure of the strength of the HC structure (Boehmke and Greenwell 2019, 421‚Äì22). For the 3 combinations of methods with larger AC, we also examined the resulting dendograms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best 3 HC structures according to the AC were the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference of the AC values are almost negligible. Consequently, we examined the dendograms:\n\n\n\n\nHC structure 1HC structure 2HC structure 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter inspecting the dendrograms, we chose the first HC structure as it seemed to form more homogeneous groups with relatively similar sizes for the different height values.\n\n\n\n3.2 Determining the number of clusters\nWe calculated and plotted the average silhouette width, total within sum of squares and gap statistic for a range of 1 to 10 number of clusters and examined the optimal number of cluster for each criteria. We defined a range of numbers of clusters that met or near met the optimal criteria and then for each one of them we used PCA to visualize the clusters in 2 dimensions to evaluate how well the groups were formed. In addition, the individual silhouette index of each observation was calculated and plotted to assess if there were observations that might have been misclustered.\n\n3.2.1 Evaluation of the criteria of the optimal number of clusters\n\n\n\n\nAverage silhouette widthTotal within sum of squaresGap statistic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these plots, we determined that the optimal number of cluster may be between 2 and 4 clusters.\n\n\n3.2.2 Clusters plots\nNext, we plotted the clusters in a plane using PCA for 2, 3 and 4 clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 clusters3 clusters4 clusters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of 2 clusters, the groups seem to be defined according to whether the scores of the observations on the first dimension are positive or negative. In the case of 3 clusters, the group with negative scores on the first dimension is divided if the scores on the second dimension are positive and negative. Finally, in the case of 4 clusters, the groups seem to be defined according to their belonging to one of the 4 quadrants.\n\n\n3.2.3 Individual silhouette widths\nNext, we plotted the individual silhouette width for the observations grouped in 2, 3 and 4 clusters.\n\n\n\n\n2 clusters3 clusters4 clusters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that with 2 clusters we obtain a greater average silhouette width (0.49), followed by 4 clusters (0.44) and lastly the case with 3 clusters (0.43). The least number of observations possibly misclustered is obtained with 3 clusters (2), followed by 2 clusters (3), and lastly the case with 4 clusters (5).\n\n\n3.2.4 HC groups on maps\nAs an additional step, for a number of clusters of 2, 3 and 4, we plotted the population centers (polygon centroids) on a map coloured by group to see their spatial distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 clusters3 clusters4 clusters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the groups seem to divide longitudinally, showing a strong spatial component driving the separation between them.\n\n\n\n3.3 Principal components analysis\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was used as an alternative method for clustering. Our approach was to use the principal component to build an aggregate index of all the variables considered. Then, the scores of the populated centers on this principal component were grouped into different categories according to the quantiles of the distribution. In order to compare this approach with the results of hierarchical clustering, we tested with 2 (50th quantile), 3 (33th and 66th quantiles) and 4 (25th, 50th and 75th quantiles) groups.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Scree plot\nAfter having performed the PCA, we plotted the scree plot to check the percentage of explained variance each component or dimension.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the first component explain approximately 50% of the variance in the data. This is not such a high value, meaning that the variables do not seem to be strongly linearly correlated. Still, 50% is an acceptable value in practice.\n\n\n3.3.2 Contribution plot\nNext, we plotted the top 10 variables according to their contribution to the first component.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the soil moisture, precipitation and runoff variables are the ones that contribute the most to explaining the first component.\n\n\n3.3.3 Coordinate plane\nNow, we plotted the population centers on a coordinate plane using the first and second components.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in the (clusters-plots?), we see that the variability of the points is distributed mostly over the first component (X axis).\n\n\n3.3.4 PCA groups on maps\nFinally, we created the groups dividing the population centers according to the quantiles of the scores on the principal component. Then we plotted the population centers on maps for 2, 3 and 4 groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 groups3 groups4 groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeographically, the PCA groups seem to be distributed very similarly with the HC groups.\n\n\n\n3.4 Comparing HC and PCA\nWe assessed how strong was the agreement between the HC method and PCA method on the grouping of the population centers, for 2, 3 and 4 groups. Confusion matrices and the Kappa statistic were used for this analysis.\n\n3.4.1 Confusion matrices\n\n2 groups3 groups4 groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the confusion matrices it is evident a strong agreement between the HC method and the PCA method.The agreement is stronger in the case of 2 clusters (kappa = 0.89), followed by the case of 3 clusters (kappa = 0.7) and lastly the case of 4 clusters (kappa = 0.67).\nFinally, we opted to work with 4 clusters because this number gives us a greater spatial heterogeneity of populated centers."
